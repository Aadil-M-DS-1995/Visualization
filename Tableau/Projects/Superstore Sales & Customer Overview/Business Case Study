Tableau Project Requirements: Global Superstore Dataset
Objective:
Create two interactive dashboards that allow users to analyze and explore various aspects of global sales performance. The dashboards should be connected with a navigation feature that enables seamless movement between them. The project should include the creation of insightful visualizations and comprehensive analysis, focusing on different layers of information.

Dashboard 1: Sales and Profit Overview
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1.	Display total sales, total profit, total quantity sold, and average discount across the entire dataset.
2.	Compare sales and profit by region (Country/State/City).
Geographical Analysis:
1.	Create a map view that shows sales performance by region. Color-code regions by total sales or profit.
2.	
Product and Category Analysis:
1.	Visualize sales and profit by Product Category and Sub-Category.
2.	Create bar charts or treemaps to display the top-selling products within each category.
3.	
Time-Based Analysis:
1.	Create a time series analysis that shows how sales and profit fluctuate over time (monthly/quarterly/yearly).
2.	Include a dynamic filter that allows users to select different time frames.
Filters and Interactivity:
1.	Include filter options for Ship Mode, Order Priority, and Customer Segment.
2.	Allow users to drill down into specific regions or cities to analyze their performance.

Dashboard 2: Customer and Order Insights
Customer Segmentation:
1.	Display sales and profit by Customer Segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
2.	Show the top 10 customers by sales and profit in a table or bar chart.
Order Details:
1.	Create a detailed table that shows information for individual orders: Order ID, Customer Name, Product Name, Sales, Profit, Discount, and Shipping Cost.
2.	Add sorting and filtering capabilities to allow users to focus on specific orders, such as those with the highest profit or discount.
Shipping Analysis:
1.	Display sales and profit by Ship Mode, visualizing which ship modes are most effective in terms of sales and profit.
2.	Provide insights into shipping costs and their relationship with sales and profit.
Customer Behavior:
1.	Create a scatter plot to show the relationship between Discount and Profit for different customers or products.
2.	Use color coding to differentiate between high and low-performing customers or products.
Filters and Interactivity:
1.	 Allow users to filter the dashboard by region, product category, and customer segment.
2.	Include a navigation button or action that allows users to switch to Dashboard 1.

Navigation:
•	Ensure there is a clear and intuitive way to navigate between both dashboards, either via a button, dropdown, or clickable action.
•	Provide a dynamic filter that links both dashboards, so selections made in one dashboard are reflected in the other.
________________________________________
Overall Requirements:
•	The project should include a balance of visualizations, allowing the user to see high-level trends as well as drill down into detailed views.
•	Ensure that the dashboards are responsive and interactive, offering a rich user experience with easy navigation and exploration.
•	Use appropriate visualizations for different data types (e.g., maps, bar charts, scatter plots, tables, and filters).
